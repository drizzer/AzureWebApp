cmd as admin

This is strictly for Ubuntu. Other distributions might have some other folder name.

bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi

Restart and you’ll be welcomed by the familiar Grub screen. I hope this quick tutorial helped you fix the Grub issue.
No success?

### If the above method didn’t change anything, you can reverse it using the command below:

bcdedit /deletevalue {bootmgr} path \EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi

Even if the above command didn’t work, try the one below to set the boot back to Windows.

bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi
